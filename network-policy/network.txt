-- We created two different pods within same k8s cluster.

   kubectl apply -f netflix-pod.yaml
   kubectl apply -f firefox-pod.yaml
   kubectl get pods
   kubectl get pods  -o wide
   kubectl port-forward pod/firefox-pod 9090:3000

   We forwarded my localhost port 9090 to firefox port 3000.
   Two pods created within same k8s cluster can communicate each other.
   Each pod has its own internal IP.
   Open localhost:9090 on browser to open firefox and hit internal IP of netflix pod with port.
   localhost:9090   -- on my computer browser
   netflix_IP:80    -- on firfox browser 
   you will find netflix will run on firefox.

   But if you want both the pods should not commmunicate with each other, you can apply Network-Policy.
   In your k8s cluster, you will have to first enable network-policy.

   kubectl explain networkpolicy --recursive > nwpolicy.txt
   Read nwpolicy.txt file , understand the attributes and create your yaml file to set network policy.
   https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/
   
   Check net-i-policy.yaml file, we are applying network policy to laila pod (line 6 - 8)
   and ingress is enabled from majnu pod to laila pod at port 80 (line 11 - 18)

   If we comment code (line 9 - 18), then majnu pod will not communicate with laila pod
   and if we uncomment this code, then majnu can communicate with laila via port 80

   Thus, it is proved that we can control communication / traffic between pods using network policy.
